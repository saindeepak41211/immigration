              <p>As the world opens up to more business between countries, a golden opportunity has emerged for entrepreneurs. Business Visas help facilitate trade and business between different countries. These are typically short-stay visas and allow visa holders to conduct business in the countries they visit.</p>
              <p>These visas are valid only for a certain amount of time and allow visa holders to conduct business in the countries they visit. A business visa is a type of travel authorization that allows an individual to visit a foreign nation for the purpose of conducting business.</p>
              <p>During the visit, they may engage in business activities that do not constitute work or employment.</p>
              <p>It does not allow holders to work full-time in the country where the visa was issued.</p>
              <p>Migrate Overseas can help evaluate your options and apply for a suitable visa which gives you the greatest opportunity to conduct your business abroad.</p>
